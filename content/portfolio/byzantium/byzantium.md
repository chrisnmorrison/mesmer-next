### Geometric poster design.

Poster design is a tenet of graphic design that requires enormous creativity, or else they will never stand out. Why? Well, think about how common posters, and even flyers are. We see them everywhere. We see them for companies, for events, and any other kind of advertising. We look at so many different posters every day that our brains tend to tune them out like background noise.

This is where creativity plays a role. How do we prevent people from tuning out advertisements? How do we get them to check out our poster over the 100 other posters beside it? 

I ask myself several questions when designing posters:

1. Content aside, does it contain visual elements that will make people do a second take?
2. Does it have enough content? Does it have too little content?
3. What symbols should I include, and how will they draw attention?
4. What do the words mean? Even if my audience doesn't immediately understand the wording, will the typography still draw attention?
5. What is the focal point? What will my audience's first impression be? 

I used to ask, "Will my audience immediately get it, or will they have to think about it?". That's a tricky question to ask for several reasons. First, even if they get it, will they still be interested in it? It's hard to create a story that doesn't adhere to tropes. Everything has already been done. It's hard to come up with a unique theme nowadays, so that often isn't my main priority. Second, how much do we want our audience to think about our design? People don't want to think. If we aren't in the mood for puzzles, we don't want to solve puzzles. Finding hidden meanings is a lot of work, so instead, how about we focus on intrigue. Instead of "let me spend the time figuring out what this means," we want people to say, "That looks cool, I wonder what it means."

When designing, I always try to incorporate some sense of mystery and unknown, but not too much. Usually, I include enough so that my audience asks questions. From there, I create a sense of curiosity.
