### Built with Speed in Mind

My [old author landing page](https://mesmerdesign.ca/portfolio/author/) had a few quirks that aren’t apparent at first glance - unused JS, complicated Hugo setup, etc.

- Cleaner, more modern styles
- Remove unused JavaScript from 3rd party libraries
- Improved, auto-generated SEO
- Fixed a few accessibility bugs
- Simplified static blog generation using the newest version of Hugo
