### The Power of RAW Images

I was blown away by how easy it was to edit this image. A high-end camera shot the original image, and came in .raw format. The extra metadata and details in the image file were the only reason that this edit was possible. This simply would not be possible with a .jpg image.

Goes to show that for the best edit possible, the type of camera matters!
