### Built with Speed in Mind

Sorry folks, Terra isn’t a real company. But, I had a lot of fun creating a full website for an imaginary business!

I created this Template Kit based on one by another Web Developer, with many added touches. This kit demo’s a full small business website, and in fact, I spent most of my time coding stuff "behind the scenes". The front-end display was the easiest part, and on top of the responsive design, I spent most of the time coding:  

- Highest degree of SEO, and in most cases, automatically generated for each page
- Blazing fast load times using React/Gatsby-specific strategies
- Extremely accessible, further enhancing user experience and SEO
- Statically generated blog using NetlifyCMS (if unwanted, very easy to remove)
- Ready-to-use NetlifyCMS to write blog articles
- Many call-to-action opportunities to boost sales
