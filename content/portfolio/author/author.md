### Built with Speed in Mind

I built this site using the Hugo Static Site Generator (SSG) framework. Hugo was the first SSG I learned, and is still my go-to framework for incredibly fast static file generation.

This site for authors uses modern best practices to deliver insanely fast load times. Besides the fastest load times possible, it utilizes modern SEO to soar in Google rank. Built with Hugo, it also contains a static blog using NetlifyCMS and Hugo components.

Best of all, static site = free hosting!

<p style=‘margin-bottom:.5rem;‘>Features that set this site apart from other author sites:</p>

- Highest coded SEO
- Blazing fast load times
- Extremely accessible
- Clean, modern design ready for all device sizes
- Statically generated blog (if unwanted, very easy to remove)
- Ready-to-use NetlifyCMS to write blog articles
- Many call-to-action opportunities to boost sales
