### Static blog powered by React + GatsbyJS

Revista is a blog/magazine template that we released completely free, for anyone to use. Simply add articles to the `/content` folder, and with a CI/CD workflow and host like Netlify, Revista will create all of your articles, categories, and more!

Best of all, Revista is open-source. If you have an idea for a blog/magazine site and would like to use Revista, you can go ahead and use it without our permission.

If you'd like to use Revista but aren't sure how to set up a GatsbyJS website, <a href="/contact">don't hesitate to contact us for a quote</a>. We're happy to customize Revista to fit your needs and set you up with static blog hosting.
