We live in a visual world. Beautiful graphics & art is everywhere, and many of them make us say, "That's amazing. How is that even possible?"

While some graphics & art styles can take years to master, the basics of digital design are surprisingly easy. You can learn the most [fundamental theory of graphic design](https://mymodernmet.com/elements-of-art-visual-culture/) in less than an hour, and you could probably understand the basic features of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator in less than a day.

Once you have the basics down, the next steps can be daunting. There are thousands of free and paid Digital Design resources, and after trying various ones, it's challenging to narrow down a "best resource." But, if I had to choose one, I'd go with Youtube.

Youtube is free, of course, and it has thousands upon thousands of tutorials on virtually everything. I have toyed with paid resources such as Udemy and Skillshare, and while I do find those platforms incredibly helpful as well, nothing beats the vast number of free Youtube tutorials on digital design.

Sidenote: This is not a promotional post. I have not been paid to promote any of these resources; rather, I am happily linking to several resources that helped me learn digital design.

If you aren't sure whom to follow, here are three starting points. These YouTubers helped me learn Photoshop and Illustrator's basics, and I continue to go back to them to develop my creative skills.

### 1. PiXimperfect

If you've searched "photoshop tutorial" on Youtube, chances are you've come across [PiXimperfect](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMrvLMUITAImCHMOhX88PYQ).

Unmesh Dinda does a fantastic job teaching advanced photoshop concepts to beginners. When I first began learning Photoshop, I thought that some things would be too advanced to learn right away. However, with a good teacher, you can start understanding advanced image editing right away, saving yourself the tedious beginner steps.

Unmesh helps you become a master photoshopper immediately in a fun and engaging format, and you should take full advantage of that.

### 2. PHLEARN

While [PHLEARN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFfd0RYax5k&list=PL7JpMMpENaD3KL_lvmw4eS5U5AD746yKB) is a paid Photoshop resource, however, they also operate a Youtube channel.

If you click the link above, you can find their 30 Days of Photoshop playlist, which in my experience, is their most helpful free resource. Aaron Nace is a fun, engaging teacher, and you will surely advance your Photoshop skills by watching his videos.

### 3. Tutvid

The last two Youtube channels I discussed primarily focus on Photoshop tutorials. [Tutvid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtnCn65MdN0&list=PLwnXQvUxjbNsvCG_rJJ8vzhbqtEjphKsf) is the first Youtube channel that I ever watched that covered the entire Adobe suite, and I continue to go back for more content. I linked to a playlist by Tutvid that covers Illustrator, Adobe's fantastic vector editing program.

Most of Tutvid's content is fast-paced, no-nonsense tutorials that create full projects, such as beautiful vector art. [Here is my favourite Illustrator video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2SNeH9v-Ug), where you will follow a tutorial to create a glass-like planet.

### Final Thoughts

I have nothing against paid resources like Udemy or Skillshare. I love the content on these platforms, and I do like that these platforms are incredibly affordable. But why pay when you can already find premium-quality tutorials for free? While you browse paid content that you may be interested in purchasing, you should always fall back on the best free resource out there - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/).
