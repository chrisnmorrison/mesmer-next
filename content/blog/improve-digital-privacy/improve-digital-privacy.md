Mark Zuckerberg may think that digital privacy is no longer a social norm, but I'm confident that the vast majority of experts and the general population disagree.

"Privacy concerns" and "data leaks" are common phrases we hear too often. Most of us have information all over the internet, and this can be concerning. There are two problems here. One, we may not want this data to be publicly available. Two, what if this information is personal, but it gets leaked? For example, Equifax had one of the [largest data leaks in the 21st century](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html). Hackers potentially stole millions of social insurance numbers, drivers license numbers, and other identifying information that could be used to steal an identity.

While I'm not suggesting that we stop giving our information to credit bureaus, the point I'm making is that we have personal information everywhere. It's next to impossible to remove our digital footprint from the internet altogether. As difficult as this would be, there are a few easy steps that you can take that may help reduce your digital footprint.

### 1. If you can't remove yourself from social media, make sure your social media is positive and mature

Long story short, your Facebook privacy settings should be high, you shouldn't have immature pictures or statuses on Facebook (or any social media, for that matter), and your digital footprint should be positive. Imagine if a potential employer searches your name. What would you want them to see? Honestly, I'd wish my LinkedIn was the first result, followed by my creative work. I wouldn't want 2012 clubbing pictures popping up, as that's a terrible way to leave a good impression.

Try googling yourself. If you don't see anything negative, perfect. If you do, or if you want more positive things to appear, look over all of our social media and see how you could make it more flattering for your potential profile stalkers.

### 2. Use HTTPS and a VPN

The easiest, first step to doing this is downloading a free add-on for your browser called [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere). HTTP is a protocol that allows you to communicate with the internet over your web browser, and HTTPS is a newer, more secure protocol with the same purpose. However, when you communicate over HTTPS, the key takeaway is that your internet activity is encrypted. Your internet use will feel the same; however, you will be protected with better data encryption.

If you can afford it, [paying for a VPN](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vpn-services) is a quick, easy way to make yourself anonymous on the internet. When you use a VPN, imagine that everything you send over the internet goes through a sort of 'VPN-tunnel', and when it comes out the other side of the tunnel, it's so scrambled that you can never find out who sent the data in the first place. With a good VPN, your traffic becomes completely anonymous, and not even your Internet Service Provider (ISP) will know what you're doing online.

### 3. Use different emails for different purposes

For example, I have three primary emails: personal, business, and an "everything else" email address. I only give out my personal email to people I know, so it's not filled with promotional emails. This email is much harder for spammers to find since it isn't plastered everywhere. My business email is (you guessed it) only for business communication. I put it on my resume and use it to communicate for professional reasons. It's not the end of the world if you combine this with your personal email, but make sure that the name of your email sounds professional. For both my personal and business emails, I receive at most one junk email every week.

Lastly, your "everything else" email address. I don't give this one out to anyone I know, and I don't even have my real name associated with it. Instead, I give it out to strange websites when signing up for their products. I use it to sign up for online services, software, etc., and to no surprise, I received 50+ promotional emails every day on this email. At least I used to, but I decided to spend an hour unsubscribing from every single annoying newsletter that popped up in my inbox.

Most websites say, "we will never sell your personal information," but the fact is, this never happens. Some sell it anyway, and sometimes your information is leaked. I found that it was much safer to assume that personal data is never safe, so I don't trust anyone with it.

If you already use a single email for everything, don't worry. It's not the end of the world. You should do two things. First, unsubscribe from every annoying promotional email that pops up in your inbox. Second, make a new email with a random, anonymous name, and only use it for promotional stuff. Want to try a service, and they require you to sign up with an email? Use your "everything else" email address. Better late than never, right?

### Final Thoughts

Managing your digital footprint is often headache-inducing, but spending a bit of time improving your digital appearance will pay off in the long run.
