The world has changed a lot since the advent of digital communication technologies like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Webex. In the wake of a global pandemic, we've all become increasingly reliant on these tools to connect with each other. While this is amazing, it's also terrifying. Technology is advancing so fast that it's hard to keep up with it all. On the one hand, we're achieving things that were once only science fiction, like teaching computers how to make decisions and taking our businesses online. But on the other hand, our dependence on technology can have some negative side effects, especially when it comes to our physical and mental health.

We all know that technology can be bad for our posture and lead to a sedentary lifestyle, but how often do we think about its impact on our mental health? Additionally, how often do we think about our digital footprint? We can safely assume that most of what we do on the internet, especially on social media, is a permanent part of our digital footprint. Try googling your name and seeing if your digital footprint is positive or negative. If you have a common name like John Smith, it may be difficult to find dirt on yourself, which can be a good or bad thing depending on how good or bad your digital footprint is! But for many, we can find ourselves with a simple google search, and [research has consistently shown](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331029914_An_examination_of_digital_footprint_awareness_and_digital_experiences_of_higher_education_students) that we often aren't aware of our digital footprint and how it affects our lives, such as employment.

Maybe you're like me, and you have a short attention span. I have a terrible habit of reading this research, then forgetting about it and moving on to something else. I have collected a few tips that'll help you avoid doing this, and I hope that by writing this, I can help you improve your relationship with technology, and I hope that I can convince myself to better apply these to my life as well.

### 1. Implement stronger privacy in your internet use

Everyone says, "just delete social media," but how many of us actually take steps to do it? While social media can [negatively influence mental health](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-0233-7), the outcome of social media use depends on many factors. If you aren't keen on completely removing your online presence, I'd suggest two quick tips to improve your privacy online.

First, improve your social media experience. I used to open up Facebook every day and witness how "happy" my network is, which affected my self-esteem. It took me too long to realize that I shouldn't compare myself to others, and when I did, I deleted my Facebook. But, it didn't take me long to re-open my account. I decided that instead of outright deleting it, I would clean it up. I unfriended a bunch of toxic people, I increased my privacy settings so that it was harder to find me, and I removed a lot of my older, cringy pictures and statuses. By reworking my Facebook to be a more positive representation of myself and my life, I found that I was a lot happier. Why? Even our digital presence is an extension of ourselves, and we need to take care of ourselves.

Second, make your browsing private. The easiest, first step to doing this is downloading a free add-on for your browser called [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere). HTTP is a protocol that allows you to communicate with the internet over your web browser, and HTTPS is a newer, more secure protocol with the same purpose. However, when you communicate over HTTPS, the key takeaway is that your internet activity is encrypted. Your internet use will feel the same; however, you will be protected with better data encryption.

If you can afford it, [paying for a VPN](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vpn-services) is a quick, easy way to make yourself anonymous on the internet. When you use a VPN, imagine that everything you send over the internet goes through a sort of 'VPN-tunnel', and when it comes out the other side of the tunnel, it's so scrambled that you can never find out who sent the data in the first place. With a good VPN, your traffic becomes completely anonymous, and not even your Internet Service Provider (ISP) won't have a clue what you're doing online.

### 2. Clear our your massive email subscription list

I know, it's tedious. I put this one off for years, and my current Gmail ended up with over 2000 promotional emails. My first email address ever, a Hotmail account created in 1999 if I recall correctly, has over 10000 unopened emails. My thought process was, "I'll just ignore them, and they won't affect me," but this is a terrible motto.

Try this instead - Sit back, put on your favourite music, and hit that unsubscribe button. Both Gmail and Outlook offer options to unsubscribe at the top of promotional emails. If you don't see the option, you will see an option to unsubscribe at the bottom of the email (at least for legitimate companies).

Alternatively, if this sounds tedious, try doing this when you see new promotional emails. When an unwanted email pops up in your inbox, hit unsubscribe right away. I have noticed a massive decrease in the number of unwanted emails I received using this method.

### 3. Stop reading about harmful technology, and read about the benefits of technology instead

Easier said than done, of course. It's all too easy to read about [how technology is terrible](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1diMvsMeRphUH7E6D1d_J7R6WbDdgnzFHDHPx9HXzR5o/edit), but how often do we read about the successes of technology? For example, modern technology is used to provide [cost-effective treatments for various medical conditions](https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=985620), and according to this article, is one of the largest driving forces of social innovation. Services like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) utilize technology to provide free education to the world. How amazing is that?

We often read about how harmful technology is, and we shouldn't forget about the risks of technology. But, it's important to remember that technology's primary goal is to help us, not harm us. Try adding some more [positive articles](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=technology+helps+us) to your reading list. I hope that it provides you with hope and inspires you.

### Final Thoughts

Technology affects the way we communicate, think, and learn. We must be aware of our ever increasing reliance on technology and how it affects our mental health. Taking a few steps to fix your relationship with technology becomes more critical every day, and by improving this relationship, you'll thank yourself in the long run.
