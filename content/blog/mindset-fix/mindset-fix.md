It can be challenging to adopt a new habit. We all have goals we want to achieve, and even if we feel motivated to learn, it can be difficult to attain our goals.

Why?

New habits can be very elusive, and this is often because of one of these two reasons:

1. You are just beginning your new habit, but you are putting in too much work at the very beginning. You become overwhelmed, even if you don't immediately realize it.
2. You are just "winging it" when you should be structuring your journey to develop a new habit.

For example, you want to learn web development. You begin by looking at websites that others have built, and you try to mimic them. You say, "How hard can it be to build a better Facebook?"

For web development specifically, you may not want to start with back-end development. You may want to ease in with front-end development. If you start with something overwhelming, it may scare you off.

What if you're trying to improve a habit, such as exercising more often? You may hit similar walls. For example, you are just beginning to jog, and you go out and jog for as long as possible. It may feel easy while you're doing it, but the next day, your legs will be in serious pain. This may dissuade you from jogging further. In hindsight, you should have eased into a jogging habit by not pushing yourself too hard on the first day. Still, you may have already moved on to another hobby.

All in all, it pays off to be prepared for habit/hobby building, rather than just jumping into it and hope for the best. Here are three quick, easy tips that will hopefully help jumpstart your new habit.

### 1. Start small, and don't overachieve from the start.

If your goal is to run a marathon and you've never run for over 5 minutes... let's be honest, you need to rework your plan. Running a marathon is certainly doable and achievable for most people, but let's take a step back before running a marathon. What should you do first? The bare minimum answer is "run regularly, and gradually increase your pace". When I first started jogging, I wanted to run a marathon, so I trained hard. I ended up overtraining, and I couldn't run for over a month due to [shin splints](https://www.runnersworld.com/health-injuries/a20840771/i-started-running-and-immediately-got-shin-splints-now-what/).

Long story short, it didn't pay off to work hard. At the time, I had no idea what shin splints were, and I learned the hard way.

Instead, I should have spent even just 10 minutes looking up beginner running tips. Additionally, my immediate goal shouldn't have been to run a marathon. I should have instead aimed to follow an established, tried-and-tested training regime. On that note,

### 2. Be patient, and find your suitable pace

Depending on your habit/goal, establishing a timeline will vary. For example, you can learn how to change a tire in less than an hour, but it'll take you months of training to become physically capable of running a marathon. Sure, this seems like common sense, but it's too easy to get carried away when trying to learn something new.

Many things take time to learn and master, and rushing will not help you. Unless you're being tested on something, don't cram. Go at your own pace, and you are less likely to feel burnt out and stressed.

### 3. Accept that it's okay to make mistakes, and learn from them

I mentioned my running blunder earlier and that I gave myself shin splints by not taking the time to learn how to run correctly. Sure, it didn't felt very encouraging, but I learned how to run smarter. I still run to this very day (well, not so much in the winter, Canadian winters can be rough!).

When I first started learning how to code, it was incredibly frustrating. I couldn't figure out the smallest things, and I felt like quitting every day. But I held myself accountable, and told myself that it'll get better. Sure enough, it did. What was difficult for me back then is easy today. While many programming concepts still stump me, I learned to love the problem-solving aspect rather than dread it.

### Final Thoughts

Greatness takes time, energy, and strong willpower. I encourage you to break your goals into smaller chunks. Be patient, play the long game, and improve yourself little by little, every day.

It can be hard to develop a new habit or learn a new skill, but being prepared is the best way to succeed.

Good luck, and be patient. You'll get there!
